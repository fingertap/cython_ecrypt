# Cython Encryption for Distributing Python Source Code

In this package, we show how to encrypt the Python source code for distribution. We include these frequently used packages:

- `Numpy`
- `Pandas`
- `PyTorch`
- Custom class

We also include the following patterns for encryption

- bash script (in `bin/`)
- submodules

Have fun coding!
